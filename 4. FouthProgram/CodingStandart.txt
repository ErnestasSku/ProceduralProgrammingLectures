    * int a, int count, char word[]
    x int ABC, int Count, char WORD[]

1.2 If a word is a combination of two words, it has to follow the camelCase rule:
    * int moveCount, int isPrime, char petName

      }else if()

    x if(<..>)
      {
          ...
      }
    else if

5. Curly brackets are written underneath the function: 
    * if()
      {

      }

    x if(){

      }

5.1 If there is only one statement after and "if", curly brackets are not necessary
